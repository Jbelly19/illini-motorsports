## [Wiki](https://github.com/mass/illini-motorsports/wiki)
All information that is necessary to know can be found in the wiki. If you have any questions about something we do on the team, that should be the first place you look.

The wiki is split into three major sections: [General Information](https://github.com/mass/illini-motorsports/wiki/General), [Code](https://github.com/mass/illini-motorsports/wiki/Code), and [EAGLE](https://github.com/mass/illini-motorsports/wiki/EAGLE).


## Archive
Code for previous competition years is also stored in this repository. It can be found in separate branches. Keep these branches separate and orphaned from `master` (never merge them in).

At the end of a competition year, we will make a new branch off of the `master` branch to archive that year's code. This way, we have a backup of roughly the same code that was run at the last competition for that year.
